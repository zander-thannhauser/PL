	{
		This program will be tested using a series of examples
		with known answers.
		\begin{itemize}
		{
			\item \texttt{addition.txt}: Assigns `z' to the sum of the two
				values stored in `x' and `y'. (Example from book) 
				
			\item \texttt{multiplication.txt}: Assigns `z' to the product of the two
				values stored in `x' and `y'. (Example from book) 
			
			\item \texttt{exponential.txt}: Assigns `z' to `b' raised to the
				power of `e'.
			
			\item \texttt{arithmetic.txt}: Tests all built-in operations using
				the values stored in `x' and `y'.
				
			\item \texttt{fibonacci.txt}: Given `x', will assign `a' to the x-th
				value in the fibonacci series using `b' and `c' as temporary
				values.
			
			\item \texttt{sort-3.txt}: Given `a', `b', and `c', will assign their
				values into `x', `y' and `z' in ascending order.
